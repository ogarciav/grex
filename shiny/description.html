    <h3>Model</h3>
    
    A family of growth curves with two shape parameters (<em>a</em> and <em>b</em>),
    that includes most of the known univariate growth models as special cases.
     It also describes probability distributions with an explicit form for
    the cumulative, useful in computer simulation, including the Burr Type
    III and Type XII, among others.<br>
    <br>
    The growth curve equation is  <em>y</em> = <em>B</em><sup>-1</sup>[<em>B</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>t,
      b</em>), <em>a</em>],  where <em>B</em> is the negative Box-Cox
    transformation  <em>B</em>(<em>x, c</em>) = (1 - <em>x</em><sup><em>c</em></sup>)
    / <em>c</em>  if  <em>c</em> &#8800; 0,  <em>B</em>(<em>x,</em>
    0) = -ln <em>x</em>.  Or <em> B</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>x, c</em>)
    = (1 - <em>c x</em>)<sup>1/<em>c</em></sup>  if  <em>c</em> &#8800; 0,
     <em>B</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>x,</em> 0) = e<sup>-<em>x</em></sup>.
     In general, <em>t</em> and <em>y</em> are subject to affine
    transformations, with additional location and scale parameters.
     Negative scale parameters reverse the  <em>t</em>- and <em>y</em>-axis,
    and are specified here by ticking the <em>Reverse</em> checkbox (both axes,
    reversing only one would give decreasing curves).  For details see Garc&iacute;a,
      O. (2005) "Unifying sigmoid univariate growth equations", <em>Forest Biometry,
      Modelling and Information Sciences 1</em>, 63-68 (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228432882">link</a>).<br>
    <br>
    The graphs at the top show the <em>y</em>-over-<em>t</em> growth curve (or
    distribution function) and the d<em>y</em>/d<em>t</em>-over-<em>y</em>
    growth rate curve, corresponding to the shape parameters <em>a</em>
    and <em>b</em> chosen with the mouse in the parameters diagram below.
     The contours in the diagram (Figure 1 from Garcia 2005) indicate the
    height of the inflection point, and common names of some growth-curve
    instances are indicated (items in parenthesis correspond to reversed-axis
    versions).  Sigmoids have an inflection point and an upper asymptote.
     Selecting the <em>Auto</em> checkbox chooses the appropriate axes
    orientation for a sigmoid, when possible.  Ticking the <em>Density</em>
    checkbox displays the probability density function.
    
    <h3>What's in a name?</h3>
    
    Attaching names to equations is
    always risky.  Very often assumptions about priority turn out to be
    wrong.  Naming the case  <em>a</em> = 1/3, <em>b</em> = 0
     after von Bertalanffy, although common, seems particularly unfair,
    given that he used a general <em>a</em> &#8805; 0  in the
    1930's.  These values contain the most useful parameter range of the
    "Richards" function, as acknowledged in Richards' 1959 publication that
    popularized it for modelling plant growth. Later, the general Richards model was derived by Nelder as a <em>generalized logistic</em>. In the forestry literature
    the function is often referred to as "Chapman-Richards", although Chapman's
    1961 application of it to fish growth follows a well-known 1957
    fisheries monograph by Beverton and Holt.  In fisheries, the von Bertalanffy model often refers to the monomolecular <em>a</em> = 1, <em>b</em> = 0 (for growth in length, instead of weight). This is also called Mitscherlich, although that author used a more general model where 1/<em>a</em> is an integer.
